electronics-facility=A specialized assembling machine that can do electronics related recipes with a built-in production boost. It hums and crackles with every cycle. 
minifuge=A crude but functional centrifuge. Only powerful enough to handle thorium processing.

foundry=A basic large furnace used for melting ores. Must be powered by heat.
caster=A basic machine to cast liquid metals directly into intermediates. Even comes with a built in loader! Requires cooling via water.
metallurgic-infuser=A basic machine to infuse solid ingredients into liquid metals. 

fluid-heater=A basic heater that burns fluids with fuel values. Has a moderate efficiency.

thorium-ore=A slightly radioactive ore. Could be used as a light nuclear fuel source if processed right. 
thorium-powder=Crushed up thorium ore. Can be useful if centrifuged with some sulfur. 
thorium-pellets=Compressed pellets of thorium. Can be useful when contained in rods.
thorium-fuel-rod=A weaker but effective nuclear fuel. 
spent-thorium-fuel-rod=A thorium fuel rod devoid of energy. Could be useful if reprocessed. 

magmacyte=An extremely hot slurry of minerals that somehow contains metal-cleaning bacteria that can withstand extreme temperatures. Useful in refinement processes.

thorium-processing=Using crude techniques, we can process Thorium into an early nuclear fuel.

basic-metallurgy=While our refining techniques have been sufficient for now, we can improve our yield and even make metal intermediates directly.

advanced-magmacyte-extraction=Using more advanced techniques, we can reduce the risk of a volcanic eruption at the cost of more power and steam.
perfected-magmacyte-extraction=Using techniques not previously thought possible, we can eliminate the risk of a volanic eruption entirely at the cost of extremely high power and steam demands.
